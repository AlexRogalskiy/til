# The Pizza Effect

The [Pizza Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_effect) describes a situation where a once "exported" cultural thing is "imported" back into
the origin country and influences the culture there.  
An example, also where the name came from, is the pizza which got several new toppings created by italian immigrants in the USA. Those toppings later
became popular in the italian cuisine.
