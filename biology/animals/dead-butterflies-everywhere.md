# Dead Butterflies everwhyere

Today I learned, that most displayed butterflies (on clothing, coffee cups or simple illustrations), are more likely dead than alive.

Emily Damstra wrote an [interesting article](https://emilydamstra.com/news/please-enough-dead-butterflies/) about this issue and explained, that the way butterflies are displayed
is the same way they are displayed when they are "pinned", like for biological studies or insect collections. The front wings are pointing towards the front and raise above the head
of the butterfly. In contrast, butterflies rarely hold their front wings above their heads when alive, but below it.
