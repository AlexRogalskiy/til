# The Dunning-Kruger effect

The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) describes a cognitive effect in which people 
think they are smarter and have greater cognitive capabilities than they really have, i.e. they over-evaluate their competence.  
This effect occurs very often in the combination of a high self-confidence paired with none or little experience in a certain topic.
