# Not everyone has an internal monologue

I just read [this blog post](https://ryanandrewlangdon.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/today-i-learned-that-not-everyone-has-an-internal-monologue-and-it-has-ruined-my-day/) about the fact
that not every human has internal monologues. You know, these "spoken-out" thoughts about everything inside your mind. But there are many people who actually can't have these
monologues and, instead, visualize scenes in their minds or words appear while they read. This is both scary and fascinating.
